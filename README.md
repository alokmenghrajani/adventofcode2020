# Advent Of Code 2020
[Advent Of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) solution in [Go](https://golang.org/).

# Introduction
Advent of Code is an annual speed programming competition. Unlike several other
competitions, you only need to submit the solution for one specific input. As a
result, code which doesn't handle every edge case can sometimes still win!

My goal this year was to improve my knowledge of Go and place in the leaderboard. It turns out these two goals conflict
with each other. It's easier to place in the leaderboard using your strongest language. It's easier to improve
knowledge of a language without the time pressure. Combining both isn't ideal.

This repo contains my solutions with little cleanup. I don't bother commenting my code. I do sometimes go back and
rename variables to improve clarity.

I hope looking at my code will help you learn a trick or two, just as looking at other people's solutions has helped
me.

# Previous years

1. I did fairly well in 2016 and 2017 using PHP.
2. In [2018](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode2018), I tried to solve each puzzle using a FPGA and forbidding myself from implementing a general purpose
   processor. I consider the endeavour a failure, achieving only 4 solutions.
3. I retroactively solved 2015, 2016, 2017 without any time pressure in [Rust](https://github.com/alokmenghrajani/adventofcode). I
   tried to comment my code to the best of my ability.
4. I retroactively solved 2018 and 2019 using Go.
